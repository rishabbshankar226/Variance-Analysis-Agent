# Reporting currency and input amounts

Each run has one reporting currency: USD (default), EUR, or GBP. The CLI accepts
`--currency EUR` or `--currency GBP`; the Python API accepts `AnalysisConfig(...,
currency="EUR")`. Unmarked amounts inherit that explicitly selected reporting
unit. This declaration does not convert amounts or perform FX arithmetic.

A populated optional `Currency` column must contain the selected code. Blank
cells inherit the run's currency. Budget, Actual, and complete driver-model
numeric fields reject currency symbols conflicting with the run. `$` is accepted
only under the USD convention; a dollar symbol alone does not prove that a source
ledger is USD rather than CAD or another dollar currency. Unsupported currencies
must be normalized explicitly outside this tool and labeled accurately.

Materiality amounts use the selected reporting unit. Keep the existing
`--dollar-threshold` option, but provide an undecorated number such as `1000`;
currency symbols on either CLI threshold are rejected. Percent thresholds remain
percent numbers, for example `5` for 5%. Calculations remain Decimal-based.

## Migration

Earlier releases discarded dollar/euro/pound prefixes and displayed every result
as dollars. EUR/GBP-prefixed input now requires the matching `--currency`; mixed
currencies fail with exit code 2 before outputs change. No silent aggregation or
currency inference is performed. Reports include a Reporting Currency line and
use that symbol throughout totals, materiality, drivers, and recommendations.

```sh
variance-agent examples/sample_eur.csv --period 'Q3 2026' \
  --currency EUR --dollar-threshold 100 --percent-threshold 5 \
  --output report.md --audit-json audit.json
```
